    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Michael Anyadioha, and I am a multi-faceted individual with
      a passion for learning, creating, and helping others. Currently pursuing
      my Master's in Electronic and Electrical Engineering, I bring a blend of
      technical expertise and practical skills to everything I do. My journey
      has been enriched by diverse experiences in fields like project
      management, customer service, and most recently, web development. I take
      pride in being honest, just, and dedicated to the people and projects that
      matter most to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I’m not busy sharpening my front-end development skills in HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and React, you can find me immersed in music, movies, or
      working on hands-on projects. I deeply value the relationships I share
      with my friends and family and believe that sacrifice and humility are
      essential to growth. Currently, my biggest goal is to become a full-stack
      developer within five years, and I’m working diligently to make that dream
      a reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fun fact about me is that, despite my serious demeanor, I have a
      humorous and playful side that often catches people by surprise! Having
      spent two years in banking before realizing it wasn’t my passion, I know
      the value of pursuing what truly resonates with me. While my perfectionism
      sometimes challenges me, it also drives me to deliver my best work and
      stay humble throughout the journey.
